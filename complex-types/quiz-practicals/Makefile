# Example Makefile for ROSE users
# This makefile is provided as an example of how to use ROSE when ROSE is
# installed (using "make install").  This makefile is tested as part of the
# "make distcheck" rule (run as part of tests before any SVN checkin).
# The test of this makefile can also be run by using the "make installcheck"
# rule (run as part of "make distcheck").

# Example of how to use ROSE (linking to dynamic library, which is must faster
# and smaller than linking to static libraries).  Dynamic linking requires the
# use of the "-L$(ROSE_LIB_DIR) -Wl,-rpath" syntax if the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not
# modified to use ROSE_LIB_DIR.  We provide two example of this; one using only
# the "-lrose -ledg" libraries, and one using the many separate ROSE libraries.
